//Use this pseducode, my old codebase already good, the database already connect so just use the existing code, all you need to do is "just organise the codebase follow this flow", "make sure every sql are already connected to database." and i want in 1 codebase, never separate.


Introduction to Shoppay System
The Shoppay system is a platform designed to function similarly to Shopee. Here's an outline of how it works:

1. Front Menu (User Interface)
The system has three user roles:

Customer (UserRole = 0)
Seller (UserRole = 1)
Admin (UserRole = 2)
The front menu presents three options:

Register/Sign Up Account
Sign In Account
Exit
2. Register/Sign Up Account
When a user chooses to register or sign up, the system will request the following details:

Username
Email
Password
Full Name
Phone Number
Registration Date (stored as a SQL timestamp)
UserRole (customer = 0, seller = 1, admin = 2)
isApproved (an attribute for user approval status)
User Role Logic
Admin Registration:

If the user selects "Admin," the system will require them to input a passkey ("Shoppay System") to verify that they are authorized to register as an admin.
Seller Registration:

If the user selects "Seller," their account registration will require admin approval.
In the database, the attribute isApproved will initially be set to 0.
The admin must approve the seller account before the seller gains full access to the system and can start selling to customers. Once approved, the isApproved attribute will change to 1.
Customer Registration:

For customers, no verification is required. They can register and log in without additional steps.
3. Sign In Account
When a user selects the "Sign In" option, they need to provide their username and password. Based on their role, the system will redirect them to the appropriate homepage:

Admin Login:
Redirects to the admin homepage.
Seller Login:
If the seller is approved (i.e., isApproved = 1), the system redirects them to the seller homepage.
If the seller is not approved (isApproved = 0), the system displays the message:
"Login failed: Your account is not approved yet."
Customer Login:
Redirects to the customer homepage.
4. Exit
Selecting this option will shut down the terminal or close the system.
Additional Notes for Evaluation
The database design should include fields for UserRole and isApproved to manage roles and approval statuses effectively.

Admin Main Menu
When the admin logs into the system, they are presented with the following options:

Manage Products
Approve Registered Sellers
Coupon Management
Monitor All Wallet Transactions
Update Commission Rate
View Platform Sales Reports
Logout
Detailed Functionality of Each Option
1. Manage Products System
Description:
Admin has complete control over products in the system. To make product management more efficient, implement a system with the following features:
A page showing seller-specific stores based on UserID for users with UserRole = 1 (sellers). Admin can view each seller’s products separately without mixing them with others.
An option to view all products in the system, similar to how customers browse products. Here, the admin can:
CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete products.
Search products by name or keyword.
Sort products by price or alphabetical order.
Ensure there is a "Back" button to return to the Admin Main Menu.
2. Approve Registered Sellers
Description:
Admin can approve or reject seller registration requests. Design a page interface with the following functionality:
Display a list of pending seller applications with details like UserID, store name, and registration date.
For each pending application, admin has the following options:
Accept: Updates the isApproved attribute to 1, granting seller access to the platform.
Reject: Leaves the isApproved attribute as 0, keeping the application in the pending state.
Delete Application: Permanently removes the seller's application from the database.
3. Coupon Management
Description:
Admin can create and manage discount coupons. These coupons can be used by customers to get discounts during payment. Design this section similarly to how sellers add products, with fields like:
Coupon Code: A unique identifier for the coupon.
Discount Amount/Percentage: Specifies the value of the discount.
Validity Period: Start and end date for the coupon.
Applicable Conditions: Minimum purchase value or specific product categories eligible for the coupon. Ensure that customers can redeem these coupons during checkout to reduce their payment amount.
4. Monitor All Wallet Transactions
Description:
This section displays a record of all transactions on the platform, including:
Details of transactions such as:
Transaction ID
Date and time
Amount
UserID of the customer and seller involved.
Admin can view the platform's profit:

Show a total profit summary across all transactions. This allows the admin to monitor financial activities and performance of the platform.
5. Update Commission Rate
Description:
Admin can update the commission rate that is charged to sellers for each sale. This page should have:
A field to input the new commission rate (percentage).
A summary showing the projected profit based on the total sales and the updated commission rate. This feature lets the admin manage platform profitability effectively.
6. View Platform Sales Reports
Description:
Admin can view detailed reports and analytics about platform activities, including:
Graphs and Charts showing:
Total sales (daily, monthly, or yearly).
Profit earned by the platform.
Number of sellers and customers registered on the platform over time.
Provide filtering options to select specific date ranges or categories for the report.
7. Logout
